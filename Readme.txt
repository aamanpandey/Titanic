
Dataset: Housprice

Key Points:

- Used Grid Search to tune hyperparameter of the ML models
- Used corss validation score to decide best model for the dataset

ML Algo used:
• KNN classification
• Logistic Regression
• Linear Support Vector Machine
• Kernelized Support Vector Machine (rbf, polynomial and sigmoid kernels)
• Decision Tree classification
• Two models with Bagging (best model from HW2 and Decision Tree)
• Two models with Pasting (best model from HW2 and Decision Tree)
• Random Forest
• Ada Boost 
• Gradient Boost 
• Extra-Trees
• XGBoost 
• Created a correlation matrix using prediction from all the models
• Voting Classifier to combine results of top 5 models
